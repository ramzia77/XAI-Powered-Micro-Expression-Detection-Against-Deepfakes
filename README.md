# XAI-Powered-Micro-Expression-Detection-Against-Deepfakes
Deepfake-resistant biometric authentication using micro-expressions. Proposes a CNN-LSTM framework with lightweight models (MobileNet/EfficientNet) for real-time liveness detection. Integrates XAI for transparency and blockchain for secure audit trails. Conceptual evaluation on CASME II, SMIC &amp; Celeb-DF.
